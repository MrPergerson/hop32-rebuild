## Player input
Our original plan for 32 players on the keyboard was quite unconventional and we weren't sure if this was possible in Pico8. We did consider hacking gamepad input
in such a way where each button represented a unique player, but luckily we found that Pico8 had experiemental support for full keyboard and mouse input. See 
6.13 in the manual for the details. At the start of the game, players can press any key and a character becomes assigned to that key. When physical buttons were introduced,
the keys were changed to be preassigned so that players would know which character they would play when they chose a button. The predetermined key assignemnts or assigning keys "at will" methods were both useful and a setting to switch between the two is planned. 

## Characters
A character is just a table that holds the essential data such as location, sprite, score, and other variables. Look in players.lua for the full table. When players are in the 
game and press their button, the jump function is called. Pressing rapidly performs short hops while pressing in longer intervals performs higher hops. The jump strength increases exponentially over time when the player is on the ground and resets when the button is pressed. 

## Level generation
The environment is procedurally generated in chunks to reduce memory costs. The method is fairly trivial; first fill all the grid spaces with tiles, then 
remove tiles above a height determined by a sin wave. The sin wave can be modified to allow for different terrain types, such as grass lands, desert dunes, or mountains. To change the sprite of the terrain, so they look visually different, I had a simple distance check for each biome. The terrain doesn't change per playthrough. The only thing that does change is where holes and zombies are generated. Holes are generated by choosing a tile every X distance, then clearing out a specified width of tiles. Zombies are spawned the same way, except certain surface tiles are choosen as spawn points. 

## Main loop
The only section of the code that has surivived numeruous refactors since the game jam is the main loop in main.lua. It's a mess and difficult to fully understand, but it works, hence why it was barely touched. Although this did come with some consequences, such as player.lua having to take on some of the game loop. Any changes to how the game starts and ends, and how players join require some sort of hack.

Progression???

zombies
consider adding different sprites for each area

snow storm
- when particles start speeding up, don't jump or you'll be sweep away!

Ravens
- Fly diagonally down to the surface, then up
- Spawn in the city

UFO secret
Ride the UFO!

Kingdom?
- everyone respawns and a boss battle begins

-- add visual for zombie spawn point (or turn off ai and gravity?)

zombies
consider adding different sprites for each area

snow storm

Ravens
- Fly diagonally down to the surface, then up
- Spawn in the city
- like the UFO but the don't stop moving left/right when they come down to attract.
The attract at the roof of buildings.

UFO secret
Ride the UFO!

Kingdom?
- everyone respawns and a boss battle begins

-- add visual for zombie spawn point (or turn off ai and gravity?)
